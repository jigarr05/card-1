            <h3>I'm really sorry for everything...</h3>
            <p>I just want to say sorry for everything. I know we should have met, especially jab tere paas daman mai time kam hai. I made a mistake by not saying no as I was too scared and going out with my dad. I was just trying to manage both things, I completely failed. I feel terrible about my actions and the things I said yesterday. Please know that I never meant to hurt you.

                You are my best friend, and I care about you deeply. Please maaf karde yaar. Love you Dhingloo...<br>
            
            Tomm,</p>
